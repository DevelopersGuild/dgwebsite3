                                Q: I can't attend the entire meeting because I will arrive late/leave early. Will that
                                be a problem?

                                It depends on your team. While some teams are very flexible, others may have
                                trouble if members are unable to regularly attend meetings.
                                In general, we try hard to be supportive of everyone, despite time constraints.
